There is an ongoing back-end outage that is causing search to return no results
at Flathub.org. Search results in native app store clients like KDE Discover and
GNOME Software are unaffected as they perform a local search against 
cached metadata.

We are working to resolve it. {{< track "2024-11-05 18:00:00" >}}
